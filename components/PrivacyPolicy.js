			<Title id="legal-rights">8. Your Legal Rights</Title>
			<Info>
				Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data
				protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the
				right to:
				<br />
				<br />
				Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a 'Data
				Subject Access Request'). This enables you to receive a copy of
				the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
				lawfully processing it.
				<br />
				<br />
				Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
				This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we
				hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
				accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
				<br />
				<br />
				Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask
				us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
				reason for us continuing to process it.You also have the right
				to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
				successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
				below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully
				or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply
				with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
				comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons
				which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of
				your request.
				<br />
				<br />
				Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying
				on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there
				is something about your particular situation which makes you
				want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it
				impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
				the right to object where we are processing your personal data
				for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
				that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
				information which override your rights and freedoms.
				<br />
				<br />
				Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
				enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
				data in the following scenarios:(a)if you want us to establish
				the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful
				but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to
				hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to
				establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have
				objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether
				we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
				<br />
				<br />
				Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third
				party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen,
				your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
				machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
				automated information which you initially provided consent for
				us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract

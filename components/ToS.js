			</Info>

			<Title id="tournaments-and-promotions">
				6. Tournaments and Promotions
			</Title>
			<Info>
				a) <b>Joining a Tournament.</b> Joining a tournament may require
				you to pay a tournament entry fee (“Entry Fee”). The payment of
				the Entry Fee will be processed by one of our Third Party
				Providers. If you desire to to cancel your registration for a
				tournament that requires an Entry Fee, you may cancel your entry
				up to ten minutes before the scheduled start time of the
				tournament without us charging you the Entry Fee; otherwise,
				your cancellation will be subject to our Refund Policy as stated
				herein. When signing up for a tournament, you agree to pay all
				fees, payments and applicable taxes incurred for the specific
				tournament. You acknowledge and agree that all information you
				provide with regards to a tournament sign up, including, without
				limitation, credit card or other payment information, is
				accurate, current and complete. You represent and warrant that
				you have the legal right to use the payment method you provide
				to our Third Party Provider, including, without limitation, any
				credit card you provide when completing a transaction. When you
				sign up for a tournament through the Services, you (a) agree to
				pay entry free and (b) authorize Chalk/its Third Party Providers
				to charge your credit card or other payment method for the Entry
				Fee. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S.
				dollars. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with
				payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge
				becomes payable. You may be able to pay the Entry Fee with
				credits from your User Account, if and as available.
				<br />
				<br />
				b) <b>Refund Policy.</b> All sales on or through the Services
				are final. Except as provided herein, there are no refunds or
				returns for the payment of an Entry Fee.
				<br />
				<br />
				c) <b>Tournament Rules.</b> In addition to the terms of these
				Terms of Service, every tournament made available through the
				Services may be governed by specific rules that are separate
				from these Terms of Service. Each tournament is different
				because it is subject to the parameters, including, without
				limitation, interactions and rankings among event attendees,
				communications and the awarding of prizes. Such tournament rules
				will generally be displayed on each tournament sign up page and
				you may be required to separately accept such tournament rules,
				together with these Terms of Service, prior to entering into a
				tournament. By entering into such tournament and paying the
				Entry Fee, you will become subject to those rules, which may
				vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein. To the
				extent such rules conflict with these Terms of Service, these
				terms of Service shall control with respect to the particular
				tournament.
				<br />
				<br />
				d) <b>Tournament Odds.</b> The results of all tournaments
				offered depend on the number and skill levels of players
				participating. Precise odds of winning are therefore
				unavailable.
				<br />
				<br />
				e) <b>Tournament Winners.</b> A preliminary list of winners will
				be posted in the application immediately following each
				tournament. In the case of tournaments with substantial prizes,
				as determined by Chalk, posting of legally required winners
				lists may be delayed for up to five (5) business days while
				verification of the results takes place. Final winners will be
				posted following verification of winners. The results and
				winners of each tournament will be determined by Chalk, and such
				determinations are final. By registering and/or participating in
				any tournament, you agree to be bound by these determinations.
				<br />
				<br />
				f) <b>Tournament Payouts.</b> If you win any tournament and/or
				place in any tournament and are eligible for any payout in
				accordance with the tournament’s rules, payment will be made by
				our Third Party Partners to the account you have identified.
				<br />
				<br />
				g) Non-Cash Prizes. Certain tournaments will payout in
				merchandise or other non-cash prizes. User may request from
				Chalk an offer of cash payment in lieu of any prize won,
				although Chalk is under no obligation to grant such request. If
				Chalk elects, in its sole discretion, to offer a cash payment in
				lieu of any prize won, Chalk reserves the right to determine the
				exact amount of the cash offer, even if such cash offer may be
				less than the value of the prize. The User may then elect to
				accept Chalk’s cash offer, accept the original prize, or decline
				both and take nothing. Chalk also reserves the right to credit
				the account of a merchandise prize winner with cash (the amount
				of which is in Chalk's sole discretion) in the event the prize
				remains unclaimed for a certain period of time which shall in no
				event be less than thirty (30) days. If a prize has become
				suddenly unavailable, if the player is outside the continental
				U.S. or if there are other difficulties in shipping, Chalk has
				the right, in its sole discretion, to substitute the cash
				equivalent (determined by Chalk’s estimated cost to obtain the
				merchandise prize, and not the manufacturer's suggested retail
				price or any other price) for any merchandise prize. Users are
				responsible for applicable income taxes for merchandise prizes.
				Either the MSRP, or Chalk’s acquisition price, at Chalk’s
				discretion, will be used as the cash value of the merchandise
				prize. The value of the prize will be posted to your account as
				winnings and will be deducted from your account as a withdrawal
				(corresponding to timing of the shipping of the merchandise).
				Thus, there will be no change in the dollar value of your
				account, but your year-to-date winnings will increase. All goods
				are shipped F.O.B. Origin, and Chalk takes no responsibility for
				any damage incurred during shipping. Costs of shipping are borne
				by the User and will be deducted directly from the User's
				Account. In certain specifically disclosed merchandise
				tournaments, Chalk may choose to bear the cost of shipping
				within the continental U.S., although Chalk is under no
				obligation to do so. In the case of merchandise covered by a
				manufacturer's warranty, the manufacturer and not Chalk is
				responsible for initial defects, subsequent use or misuse or
				covered repairs. In the case of merchandise not covered by a
				manufacturer's warranty, the merchandise is offered "
				<b>AS IS</b>", and Chalk is not responsible for any defects, use
				or misuse or repairs. Chalk makes no representations or
